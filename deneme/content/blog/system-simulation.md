### System Simulation : An Introduction

<p>Simulation is a useful and powerful tool that is generally used to guide statistical practices and Simulation enables understanding and prediction of complex systems by using an imitiate model of the system [1]. Sometimes it's not easy to analyze and work with the real data. The real data may be difficult to measure, or we may not be able to access all data due to limited access. For this and similar reasons, scientists, usually statisticians, use idealized data to run the model. This model provides a logical understanding of how a real system or imitation of reality behaves. </p>
